# Document Service

o	What you built<br />
  This is a Document API Service that allows for management of documents.  Upload/View List/Download/Delete<br />
o	What architecture decisions you needed to make<br />
  This was created using .NETCORE 3.1 MVC and Azure Blob Storage.<br />
o	Future improvements youâ€™d like to make<br />
  In the future, I would like to add unit tests, error handling, and maybe even a preview of the document in the UI.
